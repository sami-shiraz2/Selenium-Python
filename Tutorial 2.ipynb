      "HTTP MethodsIn this tutorial we will talk about HTTP methods. HTTP methods are the standard way of sending information to and from a web server. To break it down, a website runs on a server or multiple servers and simple returns information to a client (web-browser). Information is exchanged between the client and the server […]\n",
      "Creating a Base Template So you may have realized that creating new web pages for every single page on our website is extremely inefficient. Especially when our website follows a theme and has similar elements (like a sidebar) on every page. This is where template inheritance comes in. We will talk about how to inherit […]\n",
      "Redirecting ContinuedStarting from where we left off in the last tutorial. I wanted to show how to redirect to a function that takes an argument (like our user function). To do this we simply need to define the parameter name and a value in the url_for function, like below.from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for app […]\n",
      "What is Flask?Flask is a known as a micro web framework. This means it provides some basic functionality to allow developers to build simple websites. It does not come with all the bells and whistles like some other web frameworks like django have and therefore is typically not used for complex websites. However, there is […]\n",

PLEASE USE THE CODE BELOW, IT FIXES SOME ERRORS FROM THE VIDEO ABOVE Finishing get_date() Now that we have extracted the information from the text it’s time to process it. There are a few scenarios we need to consider: 1. We have […]\n",
      "Getting User Input In the last tutorial we learned how to output sound from our python script using the gTTS module. In this video we will do the opposite, we will get user input and turn it into text data that we can process. Let’s get started by creating a function called get_audio. def get_audio(): […]\n",

Creating a Basic GUI I’ve started this tutorial by creating a very minimal GUI that contains one button. This way we can use the button press to trigger a popup/mesagebox. This is […]\n",
